  "content": "*When we created the Girl Declaration, more than 500 adolescent girls were consulted across 14 countries. Hannatu\u2019s story reflects the challenges faced by many of the girls we spoke to...* \r\n \r\n**Education, Health and Citizenship**\r\n\r\nHannatu a 12-year-old girl from Nigeria, talks about there being no hospital near where her family lives and transportation to the nearest one being too expensive, which makes it difficult for her to get medical attention.\r\n\r\nMost of her sisters and brothers are born at home and therefore aren't 'recorded'. That means they don't have birth certificates because her family can't afford to buy them. Without a birth certificate they're not allowed to enrol in school.\r\n\r\nIt was the stories of girls like Hannatu that shaped the health and citizenship goals in the Girl Declaration, which tells global leaders what girls need to thrive. \r\n \r\n**Girls are the future mothers of every child born into poverty. If she has  the information and services she needs to stay healthy she could stop poverty before it begins. That's the Girl Effect. Read the Girl Declaration in full.** \r\n",
